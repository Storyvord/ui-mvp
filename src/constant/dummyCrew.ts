      "Ryan is a New York-based filmmaker with a flair for turning subtle, everyday moments into compelling stories with broad appeal, particularly through the universal language of sports.\n\nHis journey behind the camera began on the sidelines of high school football games in Texas. As he moved on to film and documentary work, Ryan developed a profound belief in the power of empathy, drawing from a tapestry of his own diverse human experiences that would inspire his approach to narratives that resonate deeply and authentically.\n\nEducated at NYU's graduate film program, Ryan's foundation in filmmaking is robust, recognized by industry accolades such as the Best Test Commercial at YDA in Cannes for his Nike spot \"Buckets\". His debut transcends the arena of sports, offering a lens into the human condition and capturing the collective ethos that brands and agencies strive to embody.\n\nWith an eye for the emotive force of storytelling, Ryan’s ambition is to craft campaigns that don't just sell, but also tell a story that audiences will remember and feel a part of. His vision for the future is expansive, seeking to collaborate on projects that challenge societal norms and ignite conversations.\n\nBrands and agencies should partner with Ryan for his fresh perspective that blends the traditional with the avant-garde, his commitment to authenticity, and his proven ability to connect with viewers on an emotional level. His work is a testament to the potential of creative advertising to not just reach an audience, but to touch it profoundly.\n\nWhen not weaving narratives, Ryan is usually cooking at home in Brooklyn, or exploring the world’s coastlines with his fiancée Stephanie.",

      "I'm a freelance filmmaker and video journalist focused primarily on documentary projects. I'm currently picking up short-term gigs as a Freelance Producer, Editor, or Videographer while I work on a part-time commissioned short documentary based out of Nebraska.\n\nI most recently finished working on a project with production company Meerkat Media on a commission from Sesame Street in Communities. The project entails documentary-style educational videos about how to talk to kids about race and racism through observing real families in conversation with their children.\n\nPrior to delving into full-time freelance life, I worked as an Associate Producer on seven feature-length historic documentaries produced by CNN Specials as well as an observational film produced by HBO Max/CNN Films.\n\nIndependently, with my production partner Sana A. Malik, I produced, shot, and edited the student BAFTA-award winning documentary, Guanajuato Norte. The film follows a migrant farmworker in Connecticut and his sacrifice of being away from his family to provide a better life for his children. The film went on to screen multiple film festivals and was acquired by The New Yorker’s Documentary Channel.\n\nI also co-directed the short film, Chief Standing Bear's Journey to Statuary Hall, for the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs with Judi gaiashkibos (co-director and EP.) Together, we made a film to be used as an educational resource, following the historical story of Ponca Chief Standing Bear and the modern-day journey of building a statue of his likeness to stand in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn addition to working as a Director/Producer on commissioned short films and personal projects, I love helping established Director’s visions come to life as an Associate Producer, Editor, or Second Camera. I’m easily curious but particularly drawn toward stories about migration, family, social justice, and the meaning of home.",
